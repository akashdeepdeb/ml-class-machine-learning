## Intro

This folder has the assignments for week 4. Week 4 talks about neural networks and how perceptron's are take in weights as input and can predict the probability
using the sigmoid function. We can use it to make AND, OR, gates using 2 layer neural networks; however, a more complex network is required for an XOR or XNOR gate.
The week's assignment is really, really interesting - it is understandably just supervised learning but predicting text using given datasets is pretty cool in-and-of-itself!
