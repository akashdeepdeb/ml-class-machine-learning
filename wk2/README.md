# Intro

This folder has the assignments for week 2. It starts off applied machine learning by discussing concepts of univariate and multivariate linear regression. 

The multivariate regression is especially interesting as it takes in multiple features and the regression gives a good prediction using the training data sets. 

# Notes
  - computeCost.m and computeCostMulti.m use the same code
  - gradientDescent.m and gradientDescentMulti.m use the same code
