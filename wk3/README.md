# Intro

This folder has the assignments for week 3. It discusses logistic regression (which is, essentially classification) and some concepts of regularization. 

Some cases where it's extensively used: classifying emails as spam or not. Classifying some groups of students and basically grouping into binary groups. 

# Topics learnt
  - Linear regression with one variable (univariate)
  - Linear regression with more than one variable (multivariate)
  - Feature Normalization where mu = 0, sigma = 1 (like normal-gaussian pdf)
  - Using normal equation for closed-form regression
  - Gradient Descent 

And finally, after all that, you also get an aethestically pleasing 'Nice work!' table. :-)
