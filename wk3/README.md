# Intro

This folder has the assignments for week 3. It discusses logistic regression (which is, essentially classification) and some concepts of regularization. 

Some cases where it's extensively used: classifying emails as spam or not. Classifying some groups of students and basically grouping into binary groups. 

# Topics learnt
  - Logistic regression
  - Classification
  - Regularization (using lambda to minimize feature values)
  - Multiclass classification: One-vs-all or One-vs-rest
  - Gradient Descent 
  - Preventing overfitting by increasing number of features
    - This allows the decision boundary to be more expressive. 
    - which allows it to adjust to any data-set by adjusting the theta values (that's pretty cool!)
